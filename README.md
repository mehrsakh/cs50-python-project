CS50 Python Projects

This repository contains solutions for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python problem sets, including Cash, DNA, Readability, and Mario. Each project demonstrates Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.

Projects Overview
1. Cash

Objective: Calculate the minimum number of coins needed to give a user change.

Skills: Conditionals, loops, input validation, integer arithmetic.

Usage:

python cash.py


Example:

$ python cash.py
Change owed: 0.41
4

2. DNA

Objective: Identify a person based on DNA sequences using STR counts.

Skills: File I/O, string manipulation, pattern matching.

Usage:

python dna.py database.csv sequence.txt


Example:

$ python dna.py data.csv sequence.txt
Alice

3. Readability

Objective: Compute the reading grade level of a text using the Coleman-Liau index.

Skills: Loops, string processing, mathematical formulas.

Usage:

python readability.py


Example:

$ python readability.py
Text: Congratulations! You’ve won!
Grade 3

4. Mario

Objective: Print a pyramid of a specified height (like the game “Mario”).

Skills: Loops, nested loops, input validation.

Usage:

python mario.py


Example:

$ python mario.py
Height: 4
   #
  ##
 ###
####
